# 42_push_swap

The "Push_swap" project is a programming challenge that focuses on efficiently solving a data sorting problem. In this project, you are provided with a set of integer values, two stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate these stacks. The main goal of this project is to create a C language program called "push_swap" that computes and displays on standard output a list of instructions written in the "push_swap" language.

The challenge lies in finding the minimum number of instructions needed to sort the set of integers given as an argument. This involves designing intelligent and efficient algorithms that use the operations allowed in the stacks to optimally sort the data.
